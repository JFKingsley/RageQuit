#RageQuit

Ever accidentally Cmd-Q'ed out of an application, lost all your data then wished the shortcut had a failsafe? Fear not, because RageQuit is here to fix that. 

Built in a night.

===

##Installation:

Simply download the .app [here](https://github.com/JFKingsley/RageQuit/blob/master/RageQuit.zip?raw=true), allow it access to accessiblity settings, and it'll happily sit in your menu bar waiting for that slip-up.

##Usage:

Simple, just select a mode (Disable hotkey or confirmation popup), and RageQuit will sit in the background, waiting to save you from disaster. To remove, simply delete the .app, no fuss, no mess.
